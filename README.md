# egel-card-game
A trading card creator web app with live previewing, exporting to PNG and SVG and a simple UI. Built and designed using SvelteKit, Figma and Haikei.

# Context
This web app was built for my Dutch friends and I, so it contains some inside jokes most others would probably not understand. Some of the labels are in Dutch as well, so keep that in mind. 

# Website
The website has been deployed to Firebase and can be viewed [at this link](https://egelcardgame.web.app/)
